        <p class="text-left font-extralight mt-12">Hey Everyone! First off, thank you so much for visiting my page! It means the world to me as a creative. So let me introduce myself! My name is Mandy and I am a Toronto based freelance photographer.</p>
        <p class="text-left font-extralight my-4">Since 2019, I've been using my hopeless romantic-ness to capture the world and its emotions through my lens. I love to travel and my dream is to visit Iceland, Norway and The Dolomites.</p>
        <p class="text-left font-extralight">For me, photography is all about capturing moments that don't require words to give you a feeling.</p>
